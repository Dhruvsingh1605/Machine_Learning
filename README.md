# Student Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and predict student performance based on various features such as demographics, academic background, and other relevant data. The goal is to identify key factors that impact student success and provide actionable insights for improving educational outcomes.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, categorical encoding, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing patterns in the data to uncover relationships between features and student performance.
- **Model Building**: Training multiple machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to predict student performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to ensure optimal prediction quality.
- **Interpretability**: Utilizing feature importance and SHAP values to understand which factors contribute the most to student outcomes.

### Use Cases:
- **Early Warning Systems**: Detect at-risk students early and intervene with targeted support.
- **Personalized Learning**: Tailor learning strategies based on predicted student performance.
- **Educational Policy**: Inform data-driven decisions to improve educational systems.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration
- Machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model

Feel free to contribute by adding new features, improving the model, or providing suggestions!
